=================== Welcome to the E-CART Project, a unique site developed by Chandan, Susovon and Vishal. =========================



**************  PREFACE  ************

1. The main thing, which has been kept in mind   during this e-commerce based Web development, is our best efforts to make it easy, attractive & user friendly.

2. This site is developed with one simple goal in mind: grab a visitor’s attention and hold it. Why? Because that is, quite simply, how success is achieved on the Internet.

3. Case studies have shown that the average web surfer will leave a website within 8 seconds if they fail to understand the purpose or can’t easily digest the message at a glance. That means a website must inform and dazzle instantly and simultaneously if it is to have any chance of competing online.

4. My goal as a professional React Developer is to create a one-of-a-kind website that will not only knock the socks off competition, but also keep visitors coming back for more.
